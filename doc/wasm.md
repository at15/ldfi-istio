# WASM

Mixer is deprecated and new extension should be written in assembly.

- [proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk) should works with istio envoy fork
- [isto/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy/blob/master/WORKSPACE) use a [fork of envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm) with specific commit hash

## TODO

- [x] compile example
- [ ] run with minikube
